    Instructions:

    1- Clone and import the and code into your preferred IDE for java(Eclipse etc.) using a new maven project.
    
    2- There are 4 packages, same level: cases (should contain 3 test case classes), pages (should contain LoginPage), 
    suites (contains 3 testcase suites) and utilities (contains the test base class)
    
    3- Update the maven project to get the dependencies and libraries. (applitools, selenium 3, junit 4) 
    If there is a problem, please download jars manually and import them into your local project's build path. 
    
    4- Download gecko and chrome drivers for selenium-yourOS and place them under C:\software. You are free to change destination 
    folder but in that case, please update System.setProperty under utilities --> TestBase 
    
    5- Please use the 3 test suite classes to run all the tests as junit tests.
